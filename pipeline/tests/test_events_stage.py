"""Regression tests for cluster publikclip-pipeline-exit-listen-panns.

Symptom: the LISTEN stage crashes while "Detecting audio events (PANNs)…"
after the PANNs AudioSet checkpoint (models/specs.py's PANNS_CNN14_MAX, no
sha256 pinned) is a cached-but-corrupted file. models/registry.py's
ensure() trusts an already-cached file with zero validation
(`if dest.exists(): return dest`), so a truncated/corrupted download is
cached forever; vendor/panns/models.py's load_model() then calls
torch.load() on it, raising pickle.UnpicklingError / RuntimeError /
zipfile.BadZipFile depending on the truncation point -- none of which is a
`jobs.queue.StageError`. Left unwrapped, that escaped cli.py's
`except queue.StageError` uncaught and crashed the whole Python sidecar
with no final `{"event": "result", ...}` JSONL line: the Tauri shell
(app/src-tauri/src/main.rs) only sees stdout stop and a non-zero exit, and
emits a generic `{"event": "exited"}` that the UI renders as "The pipeline
exited unexpectedly." with zero attribution. The events checkpoint is only
written after a successful stage.run() return, so every "Resume" just
re-ran EventsStage into the identical crash (the reporter's "pipeline keeps
quitting" after hours on one video).

These tests exercise the two independent layers of the fix without a real
PANNs checkpoint or GPU (see oracle.sh in bugfix-lab/work for the
full-process, real-torch.load version of this same check):

1. `EventsStage.run()` now wraps both `registry.ensure(specs.PANNS_CNN14_MAX,
   ...)` and `panns_models.load_model(...)` in their own try/except and
   re-raises as `queue.StageError` with an actionable, attributed message.
2. `cli._execute()` now has a last-resort `except Exception` fallback (in
   addition to the specific `except queue.StageError`) so that ANY stage
   exception -- including ones not wrapped as StageError anywhere in the
   codebase -- still produces a graceful `{"ok": False, ...}` result
   instead of an uncaught crash.
